## [0.14.0](https://github.com/regseb/playwright-ghost/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0) (2025-07-30)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

Plugin import has changed:

- before `<=0.13.0`:

  ```javascript
  import { plugins } from "playwright-ghost";
  ```

- after `>=0.14.0`:

  ```javascript
  import plugins from "playwright-ghost/plugins";
  ```

npm dependencies of plugins
([`utils.adblocker`](docs/plugins/utils/adblocker.md) and
[`utils.fingerprint`](docs/plugins/utils/fingerprint.md)) are now integrated
into Playwright-ghost. You no longer need to add them
([`@ghostery/adblocker-playwright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ghostery/adblocker-playwright),
[`fingerprint-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fingerprint-generator)
or [`fingerprint-injector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fingerprint-injector))
to your dependencies.

You can now import just one plugin. For example, with
[`utils.camoufox`](docs/plugins/utils/camoufox.md):

```javascript
import { chromium } from "playwright-ghost";
import camoufoxPlugin from "playwright-ghost/plugins/utils/camoufox";

const browser = await chromium.launch({
  plugins: [camoufoxPlugin()],
});
// ...
```
